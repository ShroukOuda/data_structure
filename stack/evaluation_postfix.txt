step1: scan postfix exp from left to right
step2: for each symbol in postfix exp
       1) if operand is these, push it on to stack
       2) else if operator is these, pop two element
           -> op1 = top element
           -> op2 = next top element
           result = op2 operator op1
           then push the result on to stack 
        repeat until end postfix exp
step3: return (stack[top])
