step1: scan infix exp from right to left
step2: for each symbol in infix exp
       1) create prefix string
       2) if operand is these, add it to the prefix
       3) else if closing parenthesies ')', push it on to the stack
       4) else if opening parenthesies '(', add top on the stack to the postfix then pop it, and repeat until close paranthesis
                 is found and then pop the close paranthesis.
       5) else if operator is these, check precedence of this operator
            * if operator has higher precedence than the top of stack, push it on the stack
            * if operator has lower precedence than the top of stack, add top to the prefix and then pop it
                  and repeat until the top has lower precedence than the operator
step3: at end of the infix exp add all operators from stack to postfix then pop them.
