step1: scan postfix exp from left to right
step2: for each sympol in postfix exp
        1) if operand is these, push it on to stack
        2)else if operator is these, pop two operands from stack.
            -> op1 = top element
            -> op2 = next top element
           create a string by concatenating th two operands and the operator between them.
           string = "(" + op2 + operator + op1 + ")"
           and then push string on to the stack.
        repeat the above steps until the end of the postfix exp.
step3: at the end stack will have only one string 
         return (stack[top])
